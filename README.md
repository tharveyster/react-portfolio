# React Portfolio

## Description
In this project, I created a portfolio to display my completed web development projects. This was built using ```React```, and the style layout is mobile-first.

The navigation links in the header go to the appropriate sections without refreshing the page.

The page is responsive, and portions of the page (```<header>```, ```<nav>```, and the projects in the "Portfolio" section) move or resize to adjust to different display sizes.

The titles, languages, and link for the projects are initially hidden, but transition to fully opaque when a project image is hovered over, and fade away once the mouse is moved away from the image.

The contact form is now functional.
